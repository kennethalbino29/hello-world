                <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>

                 
        <p> <b>Web development</b> refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.</p>
        <p> <b><i>Web development</i></b> includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like <b><i>Dreamweaver</i></b>, and updating a blog via a blogging website. In recent years, content management systems like <i>WordPress</i>, <i>Drupal</i>, and <i>Joomla</i> have also become popular means of web development. These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface.</p>
        <p>While there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between simplicity and customization. Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have a dedicated Web development team that designs and maintains the company's website(s). Small organizations and individuals are more likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic website template and simplified editing tools.</p>
